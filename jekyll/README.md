This website has been built by Ettore M. G. Trainiti as a personal initiative.
The idea behind this website was in the air for a while and further discussions with Lukas Larazek definitely reinforced the need of making such website available for the CS community.
The feedback coming from the CS Community Building Survey of Winter 2020 reinforced this need.
So here it is :)

## How was this website built?

This website has been built using [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/Jekyll), Google Calendar, and a few custom CSS rules.

The website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), which has full support for Jekyll. If you want to know more about how Jekyll makes things easier, check out [this](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) great tutorial.

## How can I contribute to this website?

The first step to contribute is to make sure you can run this website locally on your machine.
If you know what you're doing, or you wanna start an adventure, I won't hold you back.
If you're new to this, then maybe follow these steps to run WatsUp CS locally on your machine

- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
- Fork the [WatsUp CS Git Repository](https://github.com/nu-watsup-cs/nu-watsup-cs.github.io/)
- Run `jekyll serve --watch` in the root directory of the WatsUp Git Repository
- Goto <http://127.0.0.1:4000/> in your browser
- If everything looks right you are now good to go!

You can now create a new page starting from the content available in `template.html`.
Copy the `template.html` file, rename it, and add content to it.
Feel free to work on your page until you're done and you're happy about its content and its look.

## Style

Here's a list of conventions to follow to have a coherent experience across all the website pages:

- Links to pages external to this website should open in a new tab

## My new content is ready, what now?

When your changes are ready for submission and revision, submit a [pull request](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/making-a-pull-request) to the GitHub repository.
