This website is a student led effort meant to:

- Make events happening within the department more visible and accessible
- Provide space to advertise student led and department led initiatives
- Increase awareness about resources available for PhD students

As part of the CS community, we want to make sure that we know what is happening around us.

Under the tab [Events](events), you can find talks and events scheduled by the Department, CSPAC, CSSI, and more!

Under the tab [Initiatives](initiatives), there is more info about active groups within the CS Department.

All the pointers above can definitely help us contributing positivitely to the life of our department.
This can also helps us getting to know each other more, expand our network, and make the PhD experience more pleasant.
  
Feel free to roam around this website, contribute to it, and make the most out of it!
