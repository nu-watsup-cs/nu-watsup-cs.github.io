This website has been built by Ettore M. G. Trainiti as a personal initiative.
The idea behind this website was in the air for a while and further discussions with Lukas Larazek definitely reinforced the need of making such website available for the CS community.
The feedback coming from the CS Community Building Survey of Winter 2020 reinforced this need.
So here it is :)

## How was this website built?

This website has been built using [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), Google Calendar, and a few custom CSS rules.
The website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

The first step to contribute is to make sure you can run this website locally on your machine.
