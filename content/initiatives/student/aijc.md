AI Journal Club is a graduate student reading group that meets weekly to talk about new and classic papers in the
      field of artificial intelligence.
      Each week, we have someone present a paper they found interesting, accompanied by an informal discussion.
      Past topics have included reinforcement learning, graph neural networks, bias and accountability in AI, natural
      language processing, and analogical reasoning.

Our goal is to help students stay up-to-date in the fast-changing field of AI and provide a place for students
      from different labs and programs to share their research.

Join our Slack channel at <aijournalclub.slack.com> for meeting times, AI discussion, and more.
