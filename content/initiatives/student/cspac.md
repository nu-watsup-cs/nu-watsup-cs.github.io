Founded in the fall of 2017, CSPAC is a PhD student organization representing all PhD students in the Computer
      Science(CS),
      Technology and Social Behavior(TSB), and Computer Science + Learning Science (CS+LS) graduate programs at
      Northwestern University.

## Mission

The mission of the Computer Science PhD Advisory Council is to promote the well-being of CSPhDs through advocacy
      and information-sharing.
      We seek to create and curate an accessible informational repository to connect CSPhDs with the resources they need
      for a healthy and productive graduate experience.
      We strive to elevate the voice and power of CSPhD students to address concerns that directly impact student life,
      including departmental policies and decisions.
