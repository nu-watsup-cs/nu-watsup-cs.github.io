CSSI has been founded in April 2020 to address the need of pushing community building efforts forward.

Through planning of informal and low-key events, CSSI aims to be a vector for students to know each other.

CSSI actively collaborates with CSPAC and the CS Department to make these events part of our department life and culture.

## What is CSSI up to?

CS++ Slack workspace (in collaboration with CSPAC)

- Revamp the NU CS PhD Slack workspace created by the founders of CSPAC
- Have all PhD students from CS, CS+LS, CE, and TSB onboard
- Keep workspace userbase coherent with current CS++ PhD student population

Informal events!

- Happy Hours
- Field Trips
- Movie Nights
- Board Game Knights
- And more!

## Do you have an idea? Wanna join us?

Shoot us an [email](mailto:cssi@u.northwestern.edu), the CSSI board will get you involved to push that idea forward!
