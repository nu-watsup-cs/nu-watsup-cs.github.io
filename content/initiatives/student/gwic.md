This organization is open to all enrolled Northwestern graduate students. The benefits and services provided by
      Northwestern University's student groups are available to all students without regard to any category protected by
      the law. The University believes different perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds are critical to a dynamic
      and vibrant University community, and as such all students are welcomed and encouraged to join each group.
